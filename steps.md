1. **Business Understanding:** The goal is to understand the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear model. This app allows you to see how the model changes with different parameters.
2. **Data Understanding:** We generate synthetic data to explore the concepts of linear regression. You can control the data generation process.
3. **Data Preparation:** The data is generated and prepared for modeling.
4. **Modeling:** A simple linear regression model is trained on the generated data.
5. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated by visualizing the regression line and its equation.
6. **Deployment:** This Streamlit app is the deployment of the model.
